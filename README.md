Dashboard Features
Patient Overview: Visualizes patient demographics, health history, and treatment outcomes. It includes filters for age, gender, medical condition, and location.

Clinical Performance Monitoring: Tracks clinical performance across various departments such as surgery, emergency care, and outpatient services. This can help identify areas for improvement.

Resource Utilization: Displays real-time data on the utilization of hospital resources (e.g., beds, medical equipment, staff availability).

Financial Analytics: Provides a detailed financial overview of hospital or clinic performance, including billing cycles, revenue streams, and expenditures.

Comparative Analysis: Allows comparison of different time periods or departments to identify trends, best practices, or underperformance.

Predictive Analytics (Optional): Incorporates predictive models that analyze patient data and suggest risk factors for disease progression, patient readmission, or care requirements.

Data Sources
Electronic Health Records (EHR): Patient records including demographics, medical history, and clinical data.
Hospital Information System (HIS): Data from administrative and operational systems such as patient admissions, billing, and inventory.
Patient Surveys and Feedback: Satisfaction and service feedback data.
Government or Public Health Databases: External data sources that may provide benchmarks or comparative health data.
Technology Stack
Power BI: For interactive data visualization and real-time dashboarding.
Azure/SQL Database: For data storage and retrieval, if working with large datasets.
DAX & Power Query: For data modeling, transformation, and calculations within Power BI.
APIs or Data Integrations: To connect external data sources such as EHR systems, insurance providers, or government databases.
Project Workflow
Data Collection and Cleaning: Gather data from all necessary sources and ensure it is clean, consistent, and structured for analysis.
Data Modeling: Create relationships between the datasets and develop a data model that supports the required KPIs.
Dashboard Design: Build visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and KPIs for each metric. The dashboard should be interactive, allowing users to drill down into specific data points.
Deployment and Testing: Deploy the dashboard to Power BI Service and ensure it is accessible on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. Test for accuracy, performance, and usability.
Training and Handover: Provide training to healthcare professionals or administrators to ensure they can use and understand the dashboard effectively.
Monitoring and Updates: Regularly update the dashboard with new data and enhancements based on feedback from users.
